        <h2>February 28, 2020</h2>
        <p>Today is a celebration day in our household.  The tiniest member of the kitchen staff got a 94 on this math test yesterday, and that is a celebration worthy feat!  He's not a fan of mathematics, he's more of a reader, and dreamer, and Star Wars Jedi-in-Training.  He's been working hard on his math and today he saw the fruits of that labor.  A 94!!  The reward for this is his dessert of choice, a brownie.  He's not really picky about it, really, any brownie will do, but because of his hard work, he deserves what I call <span>The Brownie</span>.  This brownie recipe produces, in my opinion, the perfect brownie.  It has the perfect crispy edges, the crackly top, chewy on the inside, bold chocolate flavor, not too sweet, perfect on its own, but stands proudly underneath a scoop of ice cream.....  </p>

            <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            
            <li>4 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 1/4 (106g) Dutch Process Cocoa</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon espresso powder</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 cup (16 tablespoons, 227 g) unsalted butter</li>
            <li>2 1/4 cups(447g) sugar</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups (177g) All-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 cups(340g) bittersweet or semisweet chocolate chips</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Method:</h3>
        <ol>
           
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Lightly grease and parchment line a 9"x13" pan.</li>
            <li>Whisk eggs in a bowl, add cocoa, salt, baking powder, espresso powder, and vanilla.  Mixture will be thick.  You may want to change to a spatula or spoon after whisking the eggs.  You can also use your mixer, but I don't feel its necessary.</li>
            <li>Melt butter on stove and add sugar.  Heat on stove until well combined and heated.  Remove from heat just before bubbling.  You just want the mixture to combine and some of the sugar to start melting.  (This is what makes the crackly top while baking!)</li>
            <li>Add the hot butter and sugar mixture to the cocoa mixture.  Be patient.  It will be very lumpy at first and difficult to combine, but it will come together.  Use a spatula so you can scrape the sides of the bowl frequently and incorporate all the cocoa goodness.</li>
            <li>Add the flour and the chocolate chips to the batter.  The batter is still hot.  Be careful to not overmix.  Work quickly.  The chips may all melt into the batter if you mix too long.  (Not a bad thing, but I like the pieces of chips in there)</li>
            <li>Turn batter into prepared pan and smooth to edges.</li>
            <li>Bake for 28-30 minutes in preheated oven, until edges are set and center tests clean with a toothpick.</li>
            <li>Cool completely before cutting and serving.  This is the hardest part, but the slices are so much neater -- if that sort of thing is important to you. If it's not, then dig in!</li>

                    <h3>Dolphins tell us about the overall health of our oceans</h3>
                    <p>Bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) are top predators and, as such, useful bio-indicators of the health and status of the marine environment. Gaining a better understanding of dolphin populations both in coastal and offshore waters – including their ecological comparison and knowledge of their ranging patterns – is crucial to protecting cetacean species and making conservation and management decisions for Marine Protected Areas.</p>

                    <h3>Two separate populations of bottlenose dolphins in local California waters - inshore and offshore</h3>
                    <p>Two separate populations of bottlenose dolphins exist in California: coastal and offshore. These two populations exhibit morphological, osteological and molecular differences. In the eastern North Pacific Ocean, the coastal population usually inhabit waters less than 1 km from shore and the offshore population is usually observed in waters more than 1 km from shore.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>OCS has been studying bottlenose dolphins in the L.A. area since 1996</h3>
                    <p>Since 1996, the OCS research team has studied bottlenose dolphins inhabiting Los Angeles waters, California, focusing primarily on the coastal population (see publications). We have found these animals to be present in the area year-round using the Santa Monica Bay and adjacent coastline mostly for feeding on bottom fish. Our past research shows that this area is an important foraging hotspot for this coastal dolphin population.</p>
                    <p>

                        Since 1996, our research team has also carried out a long-term study on the offshore population of bottlenose dolphins in California, collecting data on these animals up to 40 miles from shore. This is a challenging task considering the logistical difficulties of recording data on these pelagic and wide-ranging animals!</p>

                    <p>In 2009, our scientists published a scientific paper entitled "Ecology and comparison of coastal and offshore bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) in California". Results from this investigation highlighted the need for more studies on this offshore population. For instance, we discovered that inshore and offshore populations of bottlenose dolphins behave quite differently and we also found, contrary to popular knowledge that these two populations partially overlap. These discoveries opened the door for an all-new set of questions…</p>

                    <h3>How do we collect data on dolphins?</h3>
                    <p>Photo-identification and focal group behavioral descriptions form the key methods of answering our research team questions about these two dolphin populations living in coastal and offshore waters. Photo-identification of individuals is accomplished by taking clear photo records of all individuals' dorsal fins found within a school for comparison, much like the use of a fingerprint. Photos and videos of individuals also help to identify skin diseases and physical deformities on dolphins </p>

                    <h3>What are the main goals of this research project?</h3>
                    <p>The current project attempts to expand the knowledge of offshore populations and compare that information to a continuing study of coastal groups. Another side goal of this research is also to encourage comparison of our data with other scientists in California and along the entire Pacific coast of United States</p>

                <div>
                    <h3>Why is this project key for dolphin conservation?</h3>
                    <p>Bottlenose dolphins are regular visitors of California waters and are considered in many locations worldwide to be indicators and sentinels of the status and health of coastal habitats. Systematic monitoring of these free-ranging animals can provide key data for understanding their habitat use as well as tracking the progression of poorly known diseases and emerging and re-emerging pathogens that may impact both dolphin and human health.</p>
                    <p>Understanding the ecology and dynamics of these coastal and offshore dolphins in California waters – as well as their site fidelity and spatial overlap – is useful not only for decisions affecting new Marine Protected Areas established in California, but these findings also have implications for future genetic and population studies leading to protection of these species.</p>
